#include<iostream>

int main()
{
	int a;
	int b;

	//float z=float(a)/b;
	std::cout<<"Enter a and b=";
	std::cin>>a>>b;
	
	std::cout<<"a="<<a/float(b);
	return 0;
}

/*In this program we give the type casting like cin>>(float)b; which are invalid because error occur is mismatched type
  cin aquires only varibles means actual cin has point to the memory which acquires the address of the variable and by
  passing the varible the value is stored on that varible because cin point to the varible

  syntax for accessing namespace

	1 std::cout<<
	2 using namespace std;   write on the top outside the main after header file
